								<h1>Team Structure</h1>
								<p>The team was formed by 24 people who had different responsibilities during the production. We had 1 Producer, 7 designers, 7 artists, and 9 programmers:</p>
								<h2>Producer</h2>
								<p>The figure of the Producer was the one in charge of the management of the project. His responsibility was keeping track that the project went towards the intentioned direction by taking the appropiate decisions, making sure we were achieving the different goals for each milestone, and helping with the communication of the different elements of the team.</p>
								<h2>Departments</h2>
								<p>The team was distributed in three different departments: Design, Programming, and Art. Each department had a Lead in charge of the distribution and management of the department's tasks as well as helping their teammates with any complications they might have found. The communication among different departments went through Management meetings with the Department Leads and the Producer, and through Scrum Meetings.</p>

							<h1>Scrum methodology</h1>
							<p>We developed this project using the Scrum methodology which is more focused on short & structured sprints. The initial stage of the project was done by departments and once the project started getting on track we split into scrum teams for each of those sprints, which were formed by members of different departments that were working on the same aspect of the game.</p>
						</section>

						<!-- Development timetable -->
							<section id="second" class="main">
								<h1>Milestones</h1>
								<p>We separated the production in 8 major milestones that set different objectives and were formed by two sprints. The first stage of the project (Concept Discovery + Vertical Slice) was exploring the game concept, creating content, and developing the technology to implement it. The second stage (Alpha) focused on expanding all of the content and finishing all of the technology needed for the implementation in the engine. Finally, the third and last stage (Gold) focused on wrapping everything up, testing, and polish.</p>
