								<h1>Team Structure</h1>
								<p>The team was formed by 24 people who had different responsibilities during the production. We had 1 Producer, 7 designers, 7 artists, and 9 programmers:</p>
								<h2>Producer</h2>
								<p>The figure of the Producer was the one in charge of the management of the project. His responsibility was keeping track that the project went towards the intentioned direction by taking the appropiate decisions, making sure we were achieving the different goals for each milestone, and helping with the communication of the different elements of the team.</p>
								<h2>Departments</h2>
								<p>The team was distributed in three different departments: Design, Programming, and Art. Each department had a Lead in charge of the distribution and management of the department's tasks as well as helping their teammates with any complications they might have found. The communication among different departments went through Management meetings with the Department Leads and the Producer, and through Scrum Meetings.</p>

						<!-- Methodology -->
						<section id="first" class="main">
							<h1>Scrum methodology</h1>
							<p>We developed this project using the Scrum methodology which is more focused on short & structured sprints. The initial stage of the project was done by departments and once the project started getting on track we split into scrum teams for each of those sprints, which were formed by members of different departments that were working on the same aspect of the game.
							<h2>Sprints</h2>
							<p style="margin-top: -1em"><b>Weekly goals:</b><br> schedule to review the state of the task's progress and quality to make sure the development phase is advancing properly.</p>
							<p style="margin-top: -1em"><b>Producer & Leads meetings:</b><br> took place at least once a week or whenever it was needed. Their purpose was to facilitate the communication among departments and to speed up decision-making processes. These meetings were called by the producer and followed a previously sent organization in order to remain in topic and be as effective as possible. They also served as evaluation meetings were we individually analysed the work of our teammates to improve upon next milestones.</p>
							<p style="margin-top: -1em"><b>Weekly sessions:</b><br> scheduled every week on Tuesdays at 8:30 and Thursdays at 10:45, all of the team gathered to share the major advances of the week, take group decisions, and comment any aspect of the project that needed to. After that, we did stand ups with every scrum team, where they shared their progress and solved any issues they might have.</p>
							<p style="margin-top: -1em"><b>Daily communication:</b><br> meeting twice a week wasn't enough for obvious reasns, that is why we kept constant communication through our discord server where every department and scrum team had a separate category to communicate without bothering others and keeping everything well-organized. We also used it for any extraordinary meetings that departments or scrum teams needed, and to stay connected while working.</p>

								<h1>Milestones</h1>
								<p>We separated the production in 8 major milestones that set different objectives and were formed by two sprints. The first stage of the project (Concept Discovery + Vertical Slice) was exploring the game concept, creating content, and developing the technology to implement it. The second stage (Alpha + Beta) focused on expanding all of the content and finishing all of the technology needed for the implementation in the engine. Finally, the third and last stage (Gold) focused on wrapping everything up, testing, and polish.</p>
