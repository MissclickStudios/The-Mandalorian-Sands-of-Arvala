								<p>After closing up the final details of the project, the team gathered for an overall retrospective of the project where we exposed and analyzed the different things that we consider went well, those others who could have been improved, and general comments about the project and the experience. These are the thought extracted from that retrospective.</p>

								<h3>What went well</h3>
								<p><strong>Team bonding</strong><br>Due to covid-19 complications, all of the team sessions and meetings were online, which made even more difficult communicating and bonding as a team, which tends to create toxic dynamics. However, during the 4 months of production we managed to mantain daily connection through our Discord server not only during work time, but also during our own spare time. Consequently, that kept our communication and bond tighter, and helped a lot to lift the group's motivation.</p>
								<p style="margin-top: -1em"><strong>Awareness and tenacity</strong><br>As a team, we have encountered many difficulties during the production of the game, and even though we had very strong limitations such as time, a barely developed engine, general lack of personal motivation from half of the team, and too high expectations or comparisons, the team proudly agreed that we managed pretty decently to get around some of them and deliver and create a fun experience. We do not use these limitations as an excuse, we are aware of the full potential of the project and everything that It could have been, what makes us proud is that we did not let that get through us and instead we invested more time on finding different solutions that could express our game idea the best way possible with the resources available. </p>
								<p style="margin-top: -1em"><strong>Project direction & working pipeline</strong><br>After recognizing the different mistakes to improve upon, we appreciated that, specially around the final stage of the project, we managed to end up with highly improved work pipelines, having programmers working parallelly while not only implementing gameplay but whole high-level systems from scratch; artists creating pretty decent assets that followed a cohesive art style although their very little experience at the start of the project; and designers working as a well-organized department expanding and testing the game concept while also covering for other department's flaws or limitations.</p>
